# Klontong Mobile App

Mobile app of the Klontong App.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project to a live system.

### Prerequisites
This project uses [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) to build, test, and deploy multiplatform mobile apps from a single codebase. To build and run this project, you need to have Flutter installed on your machine.

You can refer to this [link](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) to install Flutter and set up the platform. To be able to build and run this project, you have to complete the [iOS](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/macos#ios-setup) and [Android](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/macos#android-setup) platform setup on your machine.

### Run the project

* [Set up an editor](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/editor?tab=vscode) that supports Flutter development.
* Open the project directory on your local machine using your preferred editor.
* Run the app on your preferred mobile device by referring to this [link](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/test-drive?tab=vscode) on section **Run the app**.

## Instruction Deploy in your local environment

1. Clone from this repository by download zip or https or ssh (recommended using https or ssh)
   - Copy repository url
   - Open your fav code editor _(Recommended using Android Studio or Visual Studio Code)_
   - _(Android Studio)_ New -> Project from Version Control.. -> Paste the url, click OK
   - _(Visual Studio Code)_ create folder where do you want, open terminal and paste url clone then enter -> open root folder.
2. Run "flutter pub get" in the project directory or click the highlighted instruction in Android Studio or Visual Studio Code
3. Run "flutter gen-l10n" to generate the internationalizations any concern about this please refer to this [Internationalizations](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/accessibility-and-localization/internationalization)
4. Prepare the Android Virtual Device or real device _(Make sure its supported device)_
5. Run main.dart


## Tests
To run the test, you can run this command:

`flutter test`

You can run this command to see the code coverage report:

`flutter test --coverage`

The report will be available on the `coverage/lcov.info` file.


To see the report in HTML format, you can use [lcov](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/lcov). Run this command to generate HTML based code coverage report:

`genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage/html`

Check the generated HTML format report by opening the `coverage/html/index.html` file.

## Deployment
TBD


## Contributing
This project uses the [Clean Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) design approach which has the objective of separation of concerns. This separation achieved by dividing the software into layers.

When contributing to this project please follows the [SOLID design principles](https://kessler.tech/software-architecture/solid/) that implemented by Clean Architecture design. 

This way we can have this project more understandable, flexible and maintainable.
